# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! This is where I solve and store various problems using Java, updating it **daily** to improve my coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

- Implementations of common **Data Structures** (Linked Lists, Trees, Stacks, Queues, Graphs, etc.)
- Solutions to popular **Algorithm** problems (Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, and more)
- Well-commented and clean Java code
- Daily practice problems with explanations

## 🚀 Getting Started

Feel free to clone this repo and explore the solutions. You can also use these implementations as a reference or study guide.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/datastructures-algorithms-java.git

## 📅 Daily Updates

I am committed to coding and adding at least one new problem every day to keep learning and sharing knowledge.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Java 8+
- JDK (Java Development Kit)
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.)
